### Data

Input:
- movie plot
- movie image

Output:
Probability of the movie belong to each genre

See ExampleImgRF and ExampleTextRF to understand how to prepare the data.


### Evaluation

- 10% Create a solution using both images and text with a Machine Learning algorithm
- 40% Create a solution using both images and text with a Deep Learning algorithm (CNN, transfer learning, RNN)
- 30% Presentation (5 slides)
- 20% Performance in the Kaggle competition (Normalized acording to class performance in the private leaderboard)

** Groups of two! **
